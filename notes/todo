TODO:
* Variable return formats - JSON, XML, HTTP return codes?
* Use config to instantiate proper DB type
* SQL/DB setup for DBs other than SQLite which is the first DB I'm doing
* Authentication - so one user cannot delete/modify another user's lock
* Cronjob/daemon for removing expired locks - sctipt added, need to either daemonize it or cron it.
* MORE UNIT TESTS!!!!!
* Make a LockAPI::Lock object (Moose?) and ose and ORM for the DB crap

Action Add:
    * If insert fails for fingerprint, check the existing lock for expiration.  If it's expired, we should be able to create one for the given resource.

DONE:
* Move $db into the app object: $c->app->db();
